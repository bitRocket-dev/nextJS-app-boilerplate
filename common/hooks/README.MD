## Specs

All application logic is handled through _custom hooks_, which contain all the _functions_ and _state_ necessary to implement the application's functionality

## Hooks

- Each hook should perform a specific _task_, such as managing a component's state, making API calls, handling authentication, etc. **The goal is to keep components _dumb_ and delegate specific logic to _hooks_**.
- Hooks should be written to be _easily testable_, with clear and complete documentation, in order to *facilitate reuse by other developers*.

 **Hooks should be designed to be reusable and modular, so that they can be easily integrated into any component that needs that particular functionality**
