## Specs

The _constants_ folder contains files that define constants used _throughout the application_. Constants are typically _values_ that are used _multiple times_ in the codebase, such as _API endpoints, error messages, mock data or configuration settings_.

## Contants

- By defining these _values as constants_, developers can ensure that they are consistent and can be _easily updated in a single location_. This can help to avoid errors and improve **the maintainability of the codebase**.
- Constants can be defined in a variety of _formats_, such as **JavaScript objects, arrays, or variables**. They can also be organized into separate files based on their _purpose or usage_, such as _api.js_ for API endpoints, _config.js_ for configuration settings, and so on.
- The use of a _constants_ folder helps to improve the r**eadability and maintainability of the codebase**, and can help to reduce the _likelihood of errors_ caused by **inconsistent or outdated values**.
