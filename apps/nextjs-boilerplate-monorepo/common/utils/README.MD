## Specs

The _utils_ folder contains _utility functions_ that can be used throughout the application. These functions are typically _general-purpose and reusable_, and are not tied to any _specific_ component or feature.

## Utils

- The use of a _utils_ folder helps to keep the code organized and modular, and can help to **reduce duplication of code throughout the application**. By _centralizing_ commonly used _utility_ functions in a single location, developers can more easily maintain and update these functions as needed, without having to search through the codebase for each instance where they are used.

**Each component/feature is exported individually**
